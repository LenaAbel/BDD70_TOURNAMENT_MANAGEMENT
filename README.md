# BDD70_TOURNAMENT_MANAGEMENT : Board Game Tournament Management System ðŸŽ²

## Objective
This project aims to develop a relational database system for managing board game tournaments. This system enables organizers to register players, schedule matches, track scores, and generate rankings for various popular board games.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Allows players and organizers to sign up and log in.
- **Player Registration**: Creates player profiles with details like name, contact information, and preferred board games; tracks tournament history and rankings.
- **Game Management**: Maintain a game catalog with rules, player numbers, and types (solo or team-based).
- **Tournament Setup**: Allows organizers to create tournaments, select game types, set player/team counts, and define match rules (e.g., single-elimination, Swiss system).
- **Match Scheduling**: Automatically pairs matches based on participants, including details like date, time, and location.
- **Score and Results Tracking**: Records match results, and updates player/team rankings based on scores.
- **Team Management**: Allows players to form teams, tracks individual and team performance, and enables substitutions in team matches if necessary.
- **Rankings and Rewards**: Calculates rankings based on match performance and awards trophies or badges for top players or teams.

## Scope
The system supports both solo and team tournaments and includes a user interface for managing registrations, tournament setup, scores, and rankings.

## Technical Constraints
- Uses MySQL/MariaDB for database management.
- Adheres to data security and confidentiality standards.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for data management.
- Optimizes database and query performance.

## Deliverables
- UML Use Case Diagram, conceptual and logical database models.
- Populated database with sample data.
- Minimal management interface.
- Detailed documentation and performance analysis report for main queries.
